## What is R Markdown?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown, see the following websites [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html). R Markdown is a powerful tool for automating your report creation process. When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this. 

```{r credit_df, echo = TRUE}
# readin the data
glimpse(credit_slr_df)
```

These chunks run segments of code from the analysis. They can be printed in the resulting document or not, but the information they produce is still available for analysis. In the following section we are going to turn the R script that we used to perform the hypothesis tests and estimation of the linear regression model into an automatically generated report.

## Hypothesis testing on credit data
### Difference in population means

We are interested in the difference between population means of `total_bill_amt` for those who _defaulted_ and those who do not. To answer this question, we use a 5% level of significance ($\alpha = 0.05$). 

The null and alternative hypotheses for the t-test are

* $H_0:$ There is no difference between the population means ($\mu_1 = \mu_2$).
* $H_A:$ There is a difference between the population means ($\mu_1 \ne \mu_2$).

```{r data-paired-test,include = FALSE}
# create the t_test_results varaible
t_test_results <- t.test(credit_hyo_df$total_bill_amt ~ credit_hyo_df$default)
p_val <- t_test_results$p.value
ci_l <- t_test_results$conf.int[1]
ci_u <- t_test_results$conf.int[2]
```

The resulting $p$-value from the t-test is $`r round(p_val,2)`$, which is less than $\alpha = 0.05$. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. It appears that the population means for the default and non-default groups differ. 

Additionally, we can examine the confidence interval for the difference between the two population means, which is given by $[`r round(ci_l,0)`, `r round(ci_u,0)`]$. Therefore, we are 95% confident that the non-default group owes, on average, between $`r round(ci_l,0)`$ and $`r round(ci_u,0)`$ more than the default group.

### Paired sample t-test

**Insert markdown text and/or code here to:**

* Carry out a paired sample t-test to compare `bill_amt1` and `bill_amt2`. 
* Write out the set up of the test (the hypotheses and significance level) and comment on the results using the steps outlined in the lecture notes. 
* Calculate the confidence interval for the difference and comment.

## Modelling customer spending behaviour between months

We have just discovered that there is a difference between `bill_amt1` and `bill_amt2`. We will now investigate how well we can predict `bill_amt1` using `bill_amt2`. Pearson's correlation coefficient for these two variables is `r round(cor(credit_slr_df$bill_amt1, credit_slr_df$bill_amt2),3)`, which indicates that there is a very strong linear relationship between the variables. To confirm this, we visually inspect a scatter plot of the two variables. From the following graph, we can see that there is indeed a linear trend.

```{r slr-scatter, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.cap='Scatter plot of `bill_amt1` and `bill_amt2`', fig.pos='h'}
ggplot(credit_slr_df, aes(x = bill_amt2, y = bill_amt1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() # add a trend line

# fit the linear model to the data
credit_lm <- lm(formula = bill_amt1 ~ bill_amt2, data = credit_slr_df)
coef <- coefficients(credit_lm)
conf_int <- confint(credit_lm)
R2 <- summary(credit_lm)$r.squared
```

The line of best fit is estimated as: 

$$ y = `r round(coef[1],2)` + `r round(coef[2],2)`\times x $$ 

Examining the confidence intervals for the slope. We are 95\% confident that the true slope ($b_1$) for `bill_amt2` is in the range (`r round(conf_int[2,1], 2)`, `r round(conf_int[2,2], 2)`). 

**Insert markdown text and/or code here to:**

1. Comment on the confidence interval. 
1. Interpret the value of the slope.
1. State the $R^2$ and comment on the goodness of fit

### Model diagnostics

Here we will assess the model adequacy using the following diagnostic plots of residuals which highlight departures from normality, any particularly large residuals, and cases with high leverage.

```{r slr-diag, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap='Diagnostic plot for regression.`', fig.pos='h'}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(credit_lm)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

There is some evidence of departures from normality in the tails of the Q-Q plot. We also have evidence of a point of high leverage (sample number 119), and it might be worth investigating what is different about that particular person. 
 
It seems that this is a reasonable model for predicting `bill_amt1` using `bill_amt2`.

## Accuracy of predictions

**Insert markdown text and/or code here to:**

1. Produce a plot of the fitted linear regression model overlayed on top of both the unseen test data and the training data. 
1. Comment on why the model may not predict as well on the test data as it does for the training data.
